## Notes

https://github.com/BotUsers/MCO-Menu-Checker-Online
my commits are on the master branch (or database branch if it exists)
my github id is ez-ant

In the first part of this semester, I was working on the database with Yutao Sun. 
Because we both did not implement a database before, we work together on his laptop. 
Therefore, I didn't have much code commit on database, i only upload code for add specifications and fix tiny bugs for each function after we implement the methods.
